Once upon a time, in a land far, far away,
there lived a brave knight named Sir Lancelot.
He embarked on a quest to rescue the princess
who was held captive by a wicked dragon.
Through forests and mountains, Sir Lancelot
fought many battles to reach the dragon's lair.
In the end, he defeated the dragon and saved
the princess, restoring peace to the kingdom.
And they all lived happily ever after.
