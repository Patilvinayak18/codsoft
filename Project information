This Repositery consists of three projects namely 1)random number guessing game,2)calculater for basic operation,3)word counter in text file and that are tast1,task2 and tas3
task3 respectively.I have just used my c++ programming knowledge to build this project and gain more information by building this project.
Thank You codsoft for giving me this opportunity.

here are the detail information about program and how it works.

1)Number Guessing Game
The program uses the srand(time(0)) function to seed the random number generator with the current time, ensuring that a different random number is generated each time the program runs.
It generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) using the expression rand() % 10 + 1.
The program prompts the user to guess the number and repeatedly provides feedback (too low or too high) until the user guesses the correct number.
Inside the while loop, it increments the tries variable to keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.
If the user's guess is lower than the generated number, it displays "TOO LOW!! Please try a greater number."
If the user's guess is higher than the generated number, it displays "TOO HIGH!! Please try a smaller number."
If the user's guess matches the generated number, it displays "CORRECT!! YOU GUESS THE RIGHT NUMBER" and breaks out of the loop.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
After the game is finished, the program terminates.
Overall, this code demonstrates the basic concept of generating a random number and implementing a simple number guessing game where the user interacts with the program through console input and output.
