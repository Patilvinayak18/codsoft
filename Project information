This Repositery consists of three projects namely 1)random number guessing game,2)calculater for basic operation,3)word counter in text file and that are tast1,task2 and tas3
task3 respectively.I have just used my c++ programming knowledge to build this project and gain more information by building this project.
Thank You codsoft for giving me this opportunity.

here are the detail information about program and how it works.

1)Number Guessing Game
The program uses the srand(time(0)) function to seed the random number generator with the current time, ensuring that a different random number is generated each time the program runs.
It generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) using the expression rand() % 10 + 1.
The program prompts the user to guess the number and repeatedly provides feedback (too low or too high) until the user guesses the correct number.
Inside the while loop, it increments the tries variable to keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.
If the user's guess is lower than the generated number, it displays "TOO LOW!! Please try a greater number."
If the user's guess is higher than the generated number, it displays "TOO HIGH!! Please try a smaller number."
If the user's guess matches the generated number, it displays "CORRECT!! YOU GUESS THE RIGHT NUMBER" and breaks out of the loop.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
After the game is finished, the program terminates.
Overall, this code demonstrates the basic concept of generating a random number and implementing a simple number guessing game where the user interacts with the program through console input and output.

2)SIMPLE CALCULATOR
The program defines four functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) to perform the corresponding arithmetic operations on two given numbers.
In the main function, it displays a welcome message and the available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to the user.
The user is prompted to enter the operation number (1, 2, 3, or 4) they want to perform.
The program then asks the user to input two numbers on which the selected operation will be performed.
It uses a switch statement to select the appropriate arithmetic function based on the user's choice.
The chosen operation is performed on the given numbers, and the result is stored in the result variable.
The program then displays the expression in the form "num1 operatorSymbol num2 = result" to show the calculated result.
The program handles division by zero and displays an error message in case the user attempts to divide by zero.
The user can keep using the calculator until they decide to exit the program.
Overall, this code demonstrates the basic concept of a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations and interact with the user through console input and output.

3)WORD COUNT
It creates a text file named "story.txt" and writes a story into it.
The story contains a tale of a brave knight named Sir Lancelot who embarks on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by a wicked dragon. After many battles, Sir Lancelot defeats the dragon and saves the princess, restoring peace to the kingdom.
The program then reads the story from the file, counts the number of words in it using the countWords function, and displays both the story and the total word count on the console.
It demonstrates how to handle file input/output operations and how to count the number of words in a given text using a stringstream.
Overall, this code showcases a simple example of file handling and word counting in C++.
